## ðŸŒ¸ Spring Break ðŸŒ¸

I am really excited to say that I am on spring break right now! Woke up at 10 am today - almost forgot that I didn't have school today. I will be working on some of my personal projects, as well as my board game.

## Thoughts on the 2023 LaunchX Innovation Program Sponsors

Since I got accepted into LaunchX's Innovation Program this year, it's time to check out the sponsors! The sponsors are:

- [**DocNetwork**](https://www.docnetwork.org/)
- [**Genomenon**](https://www.genomenon.com/)
- [**Connect Space**](https://www.connect.space/)

Really cool to see that two of them are medical-related, and one is about networking spaces. I will aim to get to work with Genomenon as I am interested in genetics and the use of machine learning in the medical field.
