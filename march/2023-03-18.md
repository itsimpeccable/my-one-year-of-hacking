## Singapore Inter-School Mathematics Tournament

I am excited to say that my school hosted the inaugural Singapore Inter-School Mathematics Tournament (SISMT) this year with both UWCSEA campuses participating. I am really proud of how the event turned out, and SAIS managed to get 2nd place in the tournament! I am really proud of the team, and I am really happy that we were able to host such a successful event.

## School

As always, I've been busy with school. I've been working some more on various assessments because the International Baccalaureate sure loves to give us assessments. I kept working on my board game project in design class, and I am really happy with how it is turning out: I have laser cut the pieces for the game (3D printed village flags, wooden base for water bucket stickers, etc.) and I am currently working on the rules and the game board.

I also started learning about the basics of electricity in science class; that's pretty easy for me to understand because I went through the whole Khan Academy unit on it some time ago.

## Other

I've been working on a few other projects, such as the [Sprig gaming controller](https://github.com/cytronicoder/sprig-gaming-controller). However, I will be focusing on my board game project for the next few weeks, so I won't be working on programming projects seriously for a while (although I really want to *heavy sobbing*).
