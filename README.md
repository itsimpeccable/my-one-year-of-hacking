# One Year of Hacking with Hack Club

👋 Hey there! I'm [Peter](https://cytronicoder.com) and I'm a 14 year old student developer in Singapore. I've built [a](https://github.com/cytronicoder/singapore-taxified) [lot](https://github.com/cytronicoder/butterfly-classification) [of](https://github.com/redocinortyC/samcoin) [things](https://github.com/cytronicoder/connect-four) in the past year, but I've never really documented my journey, what I've learned, and what I've built. So, I'm going to do that here.

This is a collection of all the things I've (or will!) learn and build in the next year. I'll be updating this README every week with what I've learned and what I've built. I'll also be posting updates on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cytronicoder) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/cytronicoder).

## Why?

I've been coding for a while now, but I've never really documented my journey. I've always wanted to, but I've never really gotten around to it. I've also never really documented what I've learned, and what I've built. Through this, I hope to inspire others to start getting into tech like I did, and partially to get myself the motivation to keep going.

## So, what are you going to do?

tl;dr: I'm going to learn to code, and build a bunch of things.

I really got myself in artificial intelligence and machine learning, and I want to learn more about it over the next year along with a ton of mathematics. I'm also going to make my first [Sprig](https://sprig.hackclub.com) game.

Additionally, I'm going to be learning a lot of other things, including:

- **Calculus** (I'm going to be taking AP Calculus BC in May, so I want to get a head start)
- **Data structures and algorithms** (Trying to get into USACO's platinum division)
- **Hardware** (I really want to build a gaming controller for my future Sprig board)
- **Machine learning** (how neural networks work, the mathematics behind it, and etc.)
- And a lot more!

## What will you do when 2024 comes around?

Well, I might do this whole cycle again! I'll probably take some time reflecting on what I did this year, but it is very likely that this repository becomes (sort of) a diary for me. We will see! 🤔
