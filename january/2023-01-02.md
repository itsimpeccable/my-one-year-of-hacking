### Notes on Transformers

- Models used to solve many NLP problems
- Pre-processing, model, and post-processing
  - Can process multiple sentences at once, treating them as a batch
- Tasks
  - Sentiment analysis: classifying a sentence as positive or negative
  - Labeling: classifying a sentence into a set of labels
    - Also known as zero-shot classification
  - Text generation: generating text from an input prompt
  - Text completion: completing a sentence (mask filling)
  - Summarization: summarizing a text
  - Translation: translating a text from one language to another

- `pipeline()` function
  - Connects an input to a model with its pre and post-processing steps to produce an output
  - By default, it uses models fine-tuned for sentiment analysis in English
  - Every time you use a new model, it is downloaded and cached for future use

| Steps that happen when you pass an input to a pipeline                             |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. The text is preprocessed into a format the model can understand.                |
| 2. The preprocessed inputs are passed to the model.                                |
| 3. The predictions of the model are post-processed, so you can make sense of them. |

- Available piplines
  - `feature-extraction` (get the vector representation of a text)
  - `fill-mask`
  - `ner` (named entity recognition - identifying people, places, and things in a text)
  - `question-answering`
  - `sentiment-analysis`
  - `summarization`
  - `text-generation`
  - `translation`
  - `zero-shot-classification` (it's called zero-shot because you don't need to fine-tune the model to use it)

- You can also use models from the [Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) in a pipeline

Side note: I found out that my schooled blocked access to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). I have no idea why, but I'm just going to copy the code into a Jupyter notebook and run it locally. I will contact my school's IT department to see if they can unblock it for future use.

## IJHS Website redesign

I'm starting to redesign the [website](https://ijhscommunity.org) for the International Junior Honour Society with my team using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). I created a [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/ijhscommunity) for my team to work on the technical side, and in the coming weeks, I will be working on the design side of things.

## Competitive programming

I'm going to be working on some competitive programming problems regarding BFS and DP on [CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/), such as [Graph Girth](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1707) and [Monsters](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1194). I will be working with C++ for these problems.
